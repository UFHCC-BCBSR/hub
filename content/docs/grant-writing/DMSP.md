The NIH requires a Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMSP) for most funded research. A strong DMSP describes how scientific data will be managed, documented, preserved, and shared — and demonstrates your team’s readiness to handle and disseminate data responsibly. This page provides example plans, checklists, recommended repositories, and useful links tailored to omics-based research.
