### Benchmarking Papers 
Benchmarking papers compare methods to determine, based on a set of parameters and often empirical and simulated data, what the "best" tool is for a particular analysis. Tools are evaluated on speed and accuracy, usually. (Keep in mind these papers are often published to introduce a new tool, and therefore may be biased.)
