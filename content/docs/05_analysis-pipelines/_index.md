This collection provides suggested workflows, recommended tools, and best practices for analyzing omics data across different experimental platforms. Starting with assembly and quantification pipelines, we document the essential steps of data processing and how these tie into downstream statistical analysis and biological interpretation. These guides help us navigate from raw data to biological insights using established computational approaches.

The following pages are organized by specific assay types, covering the unique analytical considerations and specialized tools required for each platform's data characteristics and experimental goals.

For more guidance on downstream analysis steps, see our dedicated sections on [Differential Analysis of Omics Data](link), [Biological Interpretation of Results](link), and [Data Visualization](link).
