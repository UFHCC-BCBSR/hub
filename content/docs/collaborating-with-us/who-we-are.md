## Submit a Support Request Form

- [Online Support Requet Form](https://cancer.ufl.edu/research/shared-resources/biostatistics-computational-biology-shared-resource/biostatistics-shared-resource-support-request-form/):

Fill out the support request form as best you can. The important thing is to get connected with us, we'll learn much more about your project later.

## Schedule a Meeting With Us

Once we receive your support request, we'll send you an email to schedule a meeting. Initial meetings are usually about an hour long, during which we want to understand your project and the expectations of a future collaboration.

## How Does the Funding Work?

The BCB-SR is a group of bioinformatics scientists whose salaries are primarily funded by effort on the grants on which they collaborate. Because of this, the ideal scenario is that you identify the need for bioinformatics collaboration **before** your grant is submitted so that there will be an appropriate allocation of funding. If this is not the case, we will estimate our effort given the project's needs and determine whether the project has sufficient funding available to support bioinformatics collaboration.
