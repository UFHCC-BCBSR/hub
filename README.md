## UFHCC BCB-SR Bioinformatics Wiki

The UFHCC BCB-SR Bioinformatics wiki is where we BCB-SR Bioinformatics members collaboratively document how to navigate bioinformatics in the UF Health Cancer Center (and beyond) from collaborating with the BCB-SR Bioinformatics unit, using the command line, finding gold-standard tools, and trouble-shotting common challenges.

This is the GitHub repository that stores all of the relevant code and content. The wiki is available at <https://ufhcc-bcbsr.github.io/wiki>

The site is built using [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/), the [Wowchemy Project Documentation template](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-documentation-theme), and the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/).

## Requesting updates to the wiki

### Create an issue

Go to <https://github.com/UFHCC-BCBSR/wiki/issues> and "create a new issue". Describe what information you would like documented on the wiki. You can suggest your own content if you just learned about a new tool or topic, or leave an open-ended request that we document best practices for a particular assay or analysis.

## Editing the wiki (for repo collaborators)

### Editing an existing page

All of the wiki content is stored in markdown files in the `content/docs/` directory.

* To edit from the GitHub repository find the associated page click the pencil icon to edit
* To edit from the website click the Edit this page link at the bottom of the page you want to edit and youâ€™ll be redirected to the GitHub repository to edit

In both cases when you are done editing add a descriptive commit message at the bottom of the page, select `Commit directly to the main branch`, and click the `Commit changes` button. If you want someone else to look at your changes before they are added to the wiki you can select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request` instead and click the `Propose changes` button and someone will review the changes before merging them into the wiki.

### Adding a new page 

1. In the GitHub repo navigate to the appropriate folder in `content/docs/` and click `Add file` and then `Create new file`.
2. Add the following YAML to the top of the page and edit the text of the `title` and `summary` fields to match the new page.

```yaml
---
title: "Hi-C Data Analysis"
summary: >
  Best Practies for Hi-C Data Analysis
---
```

3. Add the text for the page
4. A descriptive commit message at the bottom of the page, and select `Commit directly to the main branch` (if you don't want the changes reviewed) or `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request` (if you want the changes reviewed), and click the `Commit changes` or `Propose changes` button.

### Adding a new topic

1. In the GitHub repo navigate to the appropriate folder in `content/docs/` and click `Add file` and then `Create new file`
2. Type the name of the directory you want to create for the topic, then `/`, and then `_index.md`
3. Add the following text to the page and the text of the `title`, `summary`, and the paragraph description to match the new topic.

```
---
title: "Normalization Methods in Bioinformatics"
summary: >
  The importance of normalization methods in bioinformatics analysis
---

Normalization is a critical step in bioinformatics analysis whether for visualization or as implemented in differential analysis testing. 

{{< list_children >}}
```

4. Commit the changes as described above
5. You can now add a new page to the new topic
